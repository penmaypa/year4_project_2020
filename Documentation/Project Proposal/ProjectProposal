> Technical approaches
	
	> The next step is Data Cleaning. This is where the the student (the project owner) removes irrelevant data and clean from the collection.

	> The third step is to combine multiple sets of data from different sources. The sets of data could be from different areas or domain.
	
	> The next step is data selection. This is where data is decided and retrieved in relevance to the analysis. 
	
	> Then Data is being transformed into appropriate requirement; this process has two steps; data mapping and code generation.
	
	> The next step is Data Mining, which is a technique that are used to extract patterns potentially useful. Then these processed data are then used to generate reports and visualisation about the country's economy.
	

> Technical Implementation

	^ -------------------
		The technologies that will be use for this project is R and Python.
			
			^ ORIGINAL
				
					Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed. 
						
				^ Paraphrase
				
					According to Python.org (2019), Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language. Python's syntax makes it easy to read and maintain a program. Python has thousands of libraries which focuses in all areas of industries.

		^ Plothly.py 
			
			Plothly.py (Plot.ly.2019). is an open-source, interactive graphing library for Python. It supports over 40 unique chart types covering a wide range of statistical, financial, geographic, scientific, and 3-dimensional use-cases. This library will be use for developing an interactive dashboard.

	> R
		
		^ R is a language and environmet for statistical computing and graphics. R provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible (R-project.org. 2019) .

	> R and Python will be used side by side for this project.
	
	

> Evaluation

	
	^ Backend Testing
	
		> The database will be tested to make sure data are being stored when users inputs data.
	
	^ Graphical User Interface Testing
	
		> For Graphical User Interface Testing, the dashboard will be tested to make sure that the dashboard is interactive. Menus, button and input field will be verified according to the GUI mockup screens.
	
	^ Intergration Testing
		> For this project, multiple technologies will be integrated such as api, libraries and two programming langauges ; R and Python. The testing will verify and test that all different technologies work properly as one system.
	
		??? ^ Load Testing 
	
	^ Data Integration Testing
		
		> The objective for this test is to test that data extraction is extracted completely. It also involve testing the Application's Data filitering mechanism and transformation logic.

	^ Analytics Testing
		
		> This test involves testing the predictive models and its accuracy.
		
	^ Visualization Testing
		
		> Visualization Testing involves evaluating the data insights and making sure that the application is displaying charts, graph and representation properly.
		
	
	> Other Evaluation
		
		> Other datasets from other countries will also be tested to see if the application provides an accurate output compare to the project chosen country, Ireland.
